# Short hand If Else:
a = 330
b = 3303
# This is a one line, if-else statement:
# Now the, 1st condition is if a is greater than b then print A
# 2nd else print("=") when this condition become true (if (a==b)) 
# 3rd condition if none of condition is true then print B
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

# print(9) if a>b else ""
c = 9 if a>b else 0
print(c)
# Now we can also use if else with only one condition
# like above, print 9 if a greater than b and else is neccessary
# to write and double quote is also important.
